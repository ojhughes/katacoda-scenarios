This scenario covers how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster, either on your own machine or on a shared development server/Virtual Machine. The same guidance can also be used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in a production environment with some adaptations such as using signed TLS certificates.

In this scenario we will use the K3s Kubernetes distribution from Rancher as it can either be deployed locally or on a shared server. This will enable students to run their applications on a real Kubernetes cluster. We will deploy the K3s cluster onto a virtual machine.
